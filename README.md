# movie-genre-classification
Machine Learning  model to predict movie genres from plot summaries

# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Genre Classification (ML Project)

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts a movie's genre based on its plot summary. It's built using Python, Scikit-learn, and text vectorization techniques like TF-IDF.

## ðŸ§  What the Model Does

- Cleans and processes the training data
- Converts plots into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
- Trains a Logistic Regression model
- Evaluates model using accuracy and classification report
- Predicts genres for unseen movie descriptions
